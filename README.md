# Snap Lens Tool

A Swiss Army Knife for Snapchat Lenses.

The code is based on the [Blender add-on for importing/exporting Snapchat lenses](https://github.com/cvirostek/snapchat-lens-blender-io) by [Connor Virostek](https://github.com/cvirostek).

## Planned Features (Work in Progress)

- Unpack Snapchat lenses.
- Re-Pack modified Snapchat lenses.
- Set Snap Camera fallback mode on lenses.
- Auto download missing lens assets.
